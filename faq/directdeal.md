<h3 id="dd">What is a Direct Deal?</h3>

A direct deal is when one developer goes directly to another developer with an interest to cross-promote with one another.  Developers decide themselves how the deal works and negotiate their own terms and pricing. 

<h3 id="how">How do Direct Deals Work?</h3>

Before executing a Direct Deal, the Chartboost accounts of the two developers must be connected.  You can do this by clicking "Send Request" under "Connect" on the other developer's profile in the Direct Deals Marketplace, or just send us an email and we can connect them for you.

The developers negotiate the terms of the deal among themselves.  You can buy, sell or exchange traffic.  The campaign is tracked and served by Chartboost.

Once both parties have agreed upon the terms of the deal, the advertising developer creates the campaign under Campaigns ➔ Add a campaign ➔ Direct Deal.  Fill in all the required fields including selecting the partner you are sending the campaign to.  All partners you are connected with will show up in the drop down.

There are two options for invoicing: 1) Direct Invoicing is when the publisher of the campaign is directly billing the advertiser of the campaign for the terms they agreed upon.  Spend/earned are not reported in the analytics for direct invoicing.  2) Chartboost Invoicing is for when you'd like Chartboost to process the payment for you.  We take 10% of the transaction to do this.  If this is selected you must input a bid and daily budget, just as with a network campaign.  Spend/earned will be reported in the analytics.  

The campaign is then sent as a request to the publishing developer who confirms it, reviews the targets and saves it to go live. 

<h3 id="marketplace">Accessing the Direct Deals Marketplace</h3>

Prior to requesting access, we ask that you are live with our SDK integrated and have created a public profile.

Upon requesting access, we review each account individually and determine if they're a good fit for the marketplace.  Some of the things we take into consideration are:

 - The type of apps you create

 - The amount of traffic your app(s) generate

 - The market(s) you're available in

You should receive a response within 24 hours.

Please note that there are a few basic requirements to gain access into the Direct Deals Marketplace:

- Your apps must be games that are integrated with our SDK and live in the app store.

- You must have *at least* one app with over 20,000 boot-ups per day.

<h3 id="needmarketplace">Do I need to be in the Marketplace to do a Direct Deal?</h3>

No, you do not need to be in the marketplace to do a Direct Deal! If you have not met the pre-requisites for the Marketplace, we are happy to connect you manually to any partner you have that is on Chartboost.

Shoot us an email at support@chartboost.com and let us know who you would like to be connected with. We will let you know as soon as the connection is made. 

From there, you will go to Campaigns ➔ Add A Campaign ➔ Direct Deal (this option will appear once you are connected with one or more partners), select your partner, and set up the campaign.
