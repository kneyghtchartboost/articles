<h3 id="creatives">Tips & tricks for creatives</h3>

1. Create multiple versions of an ad unit for A/B testing.  After you launch your advertising campaign, you can see the CTR of each ad unit and adjust the traffic for each accordingly.

2. We recommend keeping creatives simple with very little background "noise" and a dominant call to action such as "Download on the App Store" or "Available on the App Store."

3. Create iPad specific creatives and campaigns.  Many companies will pay more to acquire iPad users as they monetize better.

4. As a publisher, creating a custom frame to surround the ad units served in your game helps it feel more like a suggestion than an advertisement, and creates a better customer experience.
