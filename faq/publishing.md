<h3 id="minbid">How do I use the minimum bid option?</h3>

When setting up a campaign to publish in the network, you have the option to set a minimum bid you will accept. If you set the minimum too high, you will only be showing a small handful of network campaigns. You might consider setting the minimum to just 0.05 CPC or $0.55 CPI - or just about the lowest bids allowed in our network. You can also view the priority list to see what a competitive bid would be in your country or region.

<h3 id="paid">Earnings- When do I get paid?</h3>

To give you a little information about how we pay our publishers...

Publishers are paid a net 30 after the month's end and we do the best we can to process your payment even before then. It is your money and you earned it! 

We remit payment of earnings when it has accumulated to $300 or more.

Bank fees are subtracted from your earnings.
International:
-Wire: $25
-Check: $10

Domestic (US)
-Check: $10
-ACH Wire: Free

Paypal:
Less than $500: Free
More than $500: $25
*Paypal does not allow payments larger than $10,000 USD. Therefore, all earnings >$10,000 will be remitted through wire transfer

Important: In order to receive your earnings we need to receive a tax form filled, signed, and sent back via email. Lastly, please be sure that ALL banking information is updated and accurate so that payments will not be delayed.

Lastly, a confirmation email will be sent to the email address associated with your Chartboost account once payment is processed.

If there are any other payment questions please contact tiffany@chartboost.com
