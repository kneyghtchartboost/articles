<h3 id="ios">iOS SDK</h3>

Developers need to integrate our iOS SDK in their app code. This is the way we can track their impressions and installs. The instructions to integrate the SDK can be found http://www.chartboost.com/support/sdk

Developers need to create an app from the dashboard to generate an app ID. This is the way we can track the performance of the campaigns associated to each app.

<h3 id="min">What's the minimum OS version you support?</h3>

We are only supporting 4.3 and above for iOS now due to the very small amount of users who still have 3.X and Apple's plans to only let you target 3.X.  However, if you are still targeting 3.0, you can simply not reference our SDK for users who have 3.X

<h3 id="appid">Where do I find the App ID and App Signature?</h3>

Integrating the SDK requires an APP_ID and APP_SIGNATURE.  To get the ID and SIGNATURE, add the app to your Chartboost.com account by going to Apps > Add App.  Fill in the required fields and click 'Save.'  The Apps Overview page will appear.  On this page, click the 'App IDs' link under the name of the app you added, and a pop-up will appear with the App ID and App Signature needed for integration.
