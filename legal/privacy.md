### OVERVIEW

This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") explains how information (both
customer and end user information) is collected and utilized by Chartboost,
Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies ("Chartboost", "our", or
"we"). This Privacy Policy applies to the websites provided by Chartboost,
including without limitation, www.Chartboost.com (the "Sites") and Chartboost's
online services ("Online Services"). "You", "your", or "customer" refers to our
customers. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy
Policy, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Online
Services. If you have any concerns about privacy, please send an email to
privacy@chartboost.com. We are located at 185 Clara St. Room 101A San
Francisco, CA.

1.  **COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION**

    Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and
    improve the Online Services, to administer and assist you with your Online
    Services account, and to provide you with a better experience with the
    Online Services. We store and process information in the United States. If
    you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide
    information to us and/or enable us to collect information from your end
    users, you hereby consent to the transfer of such information to the United
    States and represent and warrant that you have obtained all required end
    user consents.

    **Registration**: During the registration process on our Sites, you may be
    asked for certain information, which may include your name, your email
    address, the company for which you work, your country, and a password. This
    registration information is used to validate customers when they visit the
    Sites. It may also be used to send you additional promotional information
    about our services.  If you were entered in a Chartboost promotion in
    connection with your registration, we will also use your name and email
    address to contact you if you have won a prize in that promotion, and will
    ask you for the address at which you would like to receive your prize. We
    store all data associated with your account, including your contact
    information, your applications and your campaigns.

    **Cookies and Beacons**: A "cookie" is a small text file that contains
    a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that
    may be used at the Chartboost Sites: a persistent cookie and a session
    cookie.  A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the
    "Cookies" folder on your computer and remains in this "Cookies" folder
    after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by your
    browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. A session cookie is held
    temporarily in your computer's memory and disappears after you close your
    browser or shut off your computer. The Sites may also use Web beacons (also
    called "clear GIFs" or "pixel tags") in conjunction with cookies. Web
    beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page.

    If you have arrived at the Sites by clicking on a banner ad for one of our
    products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will
    contain an identification number for the ad that you clicked on, or will
    contain an identification number for the Sites that you were visiting when
    you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps Chartboost
    determine which of our ads attract the most visitors. If, after you arrive
    at our Sites, you choose to request further information from us about our
    products and services, the information that you provide in that request
    will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps
    Chartboost measure the effectiveness of our advertising. Because this is
    a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser.
    Chartboost Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information
    collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring
    URLs, etc.) about your activity at the Sites to better understand how the
    Sites are used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at
    the Sites. We may use a third-party email technology to send emails that
    you have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to
    measure the effectiveness of our advertising. In addition, Chartboost may
    serve ads on the Sites using our own ad serving technology. In doing so,
    one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your
    computer and will use information about your browser and your activity at
    the Sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.

    **Services**: When an ad is served through our Online Services, we may
    collect the following from your end users' devices: bundle id, language id,
    operating system version, device model, software developer kit (sdk)
    version, device identifier (e.g., UDID or Android_ID), IP address, and
    Media Access Control (MAC) address. The information we access and collect
    may determine the nature of the ad that the end user sees. For example, we
    use the IP address to create a country code to help advertisers target
    advertising campaigns by country. We may generate a cookie based on
    a device identifier or use other technologies to record information about
    the ads an end user is shown, as well as the ads an end user clicks and
    other actions the end user takes within the application. We share device
    identifiers and a hash of the MAC address with advertisers so that they can
    track average revenue per user (ARPU) and life time value (LTV) for the end
    users they acquire through the advertisements. All of the information we
    collect about your end users is presented to you through a dashboard
    (accessible through your account) including information analyzed by our
    analytics service (currently provided by a third party). You cannot access
    data about the end users of another customer through the Online Services.

    In the Chartboost software developer kit developers may download into their
    applications to access our Online Services, we offer developers the option
    to enable an opt-out from any tracking for end users. We encourage you to
    take advantage of this option or implement one of your own.

2.  **INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE**

    In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of
    the service that you have requested or to assist us in analyzing our
    service or information collected about you and/or your end users,
    Chartboost may provide your information and/or your end user information to
    such third party, or such third party may collect information from you or
    the end users on our behalf. We may share your information and end user
    information with third parties with whom we have a strategic relationship,
    such as advertisers. The information shared with these third parties may be
    used for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions or demographic
    profiling. We may also provide your information and end user information to
    our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of
    providing you with information on goods and services we believe will be of
    interest to you. We will disclose any information about you or your end
    users to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we,
    in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to
    claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to
    protect the property and rights of Chartboost or any third party, to
    protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
    activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal,
    unethical or legally actionable. In addition, we may disclose information
    to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or
    amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
    Finally, we may share aggregate or anonymous information about you or your
    end users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and
    other third parties.

3.  **PRIVACY POLICIES**

    All Chartboost customers that display ads through the Online Services must
    comply with all applicable laws and post a privacy policy that discloses
    the customer's use of services like Chartboost and the information such
    services collect, store and use. All customers must ensure that they have
    end user consent to use our Online Services and for Chartboost to collect,
    use and store end user data. We are not responsible for your use of end
    user data or the use of end user data by third party advertising networks
    you use with the Online Services. End users should review your privacy
    policies for information about your data practices.

4.  **CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY**

    Chartboost has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect
    your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration or destruction. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or
    alteration to data will not occur; we make good faith efforts to prevent
    such occurrences. We do not warrant or represent that your account or any
    of your information or end user information will be protected against,
    loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.

5.  **COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

    In the event that any personal information (as defined by applicable law)
    is compromised as a result of a known or suspected breach of security, we
    will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been
    compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures required by
    applicable law.

6.  **COMMUNICATIONS**

    It is our policy to provide communications, whether such communications are
    required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to
    our customers via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through
    posting of such notice on our Sites, as determined by us in our sole
    discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to
    determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers.

7.  **CHILDREN**

    The Online Services are not directed to children under the age of 13.
    Customers must not use our Online Services to provide advertisements to
    children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit
    personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become
    aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we
    will delete such information from our files.

8.  **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

    We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. Any
    such changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting.
    If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated"
    date above.
