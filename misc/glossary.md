# Getting Started: Chartboost Glossary

If you're new to mobile advertising and distribution, this is a good place to start learning the basic terminology!

### Campaign Basics

Advertiser: A developer who pays (or barters) for promotion of his ads.

Publisher: A developer who runs ads in his games in order to make money (or trades).

Cross-promotion: A campaign where you show ads in one game that promote another one of your games. In this case, you are both the advertiser and the publisher.

Direct Deal: A campaign where you have made a deal directly with another developer to buy, sell, or trade traffic. You can be an advertiser or a publisher.

Network: A campaign that runs through Chartboost’s game-only ad network, which pulls ads from a pool of advertisers and distributes them to many publishers. You can be an advertiser or a publisher.

Cost per Install Campaign (CPI): A campaign where you pay for each install your app receives from Chartboost ads.

Cost per Click Campaign (CPC): A campaign where you pay for each click your ad receives.

### Anatomy of an Ad

Interstitial: A full-screen ad that pops up either when the app is booted up or at some point between bouts of gameplay. This is the only size of ad unit that Chartboost serves.

Creative/Asset/Ad Unit: The image that you upload as an advertiser to be shown when ads for your game pop up. Find instructions for making creatives here.

Call to Action (CTA): A button, graphic, or text on an ad creative that prompts a user to download the advertised app (ie “Download now on the App Store”). If you are advertising an iOS app, be sure to follow Apple’s CTA Guidelines here.

A/B Testing: The process of uploading and running multiple creatives to see whether one performs better than the other (you can compare colors, CTAs, images, etc).

Frame: The image that surrounds ads that are served in your game as a publisher. Adding a frame allows you to customize the look/feel of ads in your app, but is optional. Find instructions here.

Close Button: An integral part of the frame, this button allows users to close an interstitial and is typically displayed as an “X” in the upper corner of a frame.

### Campaign Performance

Impression: An impression is counted each time an ad is shown to a user.

Click: A click is counted each time a user taps an ad that is shown to them.

Install: An install is counted every time a user launches an app for the first time that they downloaded after clicking an ad.

Impressions/Clicks/Installs Delivered: Metrics for a publishing campaign (ie, the campaign shown to users in your app delivered 1200 installs to advertisers in the network).

Impressions/Clicks/Installs Received: Metrics for an advertising campaign (ie, your network advertising campaign received 1200 new installs of your app).

All Installs: We track all your new users, not just the ones coming from Chartboost. This number includes all users that the Chartboost server is seeing for the first time, regardless of where they came from.

Click-Through Rate (CTR): The percentage of the time that a user clicked an ad after an impression was served to them. CTR = Clicks/Impressions

Install Rate (i-rate): The percentage of the time that a user downloaded an app after they clicked on an ad for it. i-rate = Installs/Clicks

eCPM: The effective cost (if you’re an advertiser) or revenue (if you’re a publisher) per thousand impressions served. Also the value that the Chartboost network uses to rank campaigns. eCPM = Money/Impressions*1000

### Tech Stuff

SDK: Software Development Kit. Code that we have created that is integrated into your application so that we can serve ads and run analytics for your campaign.

Unity Plugin: If you used Unity to develop your game, you can use this [plugin] (http://prime31.com/unity/#ChartBoost) to integrate with Chartboost.

### Direct Deals

Direct Deals Marketplace: A “social network” for game developers to meet and make direct deals. You need to meet a few requirements to have access to the direct deals marketplace; apply under the Marketplace tab above. Being in the direct deals marketplace is NOT a requirement to do direct deals - you can still do direct deals with partners you’ve met or talked to outside of Chartboost, just email us and let us know to connect you.

Direct Deal Profile: This is your public facing persona for your company on the Direct Deals Marketplace. This is a helpful place to list your apps, demographics, and what kind of campaigns you are interested in running (Advertising/Publishing).

Direct Invoicing: When creating a direct deal, choose Direct Invoicing if you and your partner will be handling all money transactions yourselves. Chartboost will track your impressions, clicks, and installs, but tracking money is up to you. The publisher keeps 100% of the money paid by the advertisers. Also choose this option if there is no money changing hands.

Chartboost Invoicing: Choose this option if you want Chartboost to track and handle payment and invoicing. In this case, the publisher keeps 90% of the money paid by the advertiser.

### Money Stuff

Balance: How much you have left to spend as an advertiser. If this number is negative, you won’t be able to run any campaigns until you deposit more money in your account.

Earnings: How much you have earned as a publisher with Chartboost.
