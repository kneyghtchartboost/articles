<h2 id="lists">Device Lists</h2>

A device list is simple list of UUID's that lets you organize your users into groups. Within a campaign, you can then use these tags for two different purposes:

**Inclusion List**: An inclusion list lets you target a specific list of devices. Any device not in the inclusion list will not be served an interstitial.

**Exclusion List**: An exclusion list lets you block a specific list of devices. Any device in this list will not served an interstitial.

Once you have assigned devices to a specific list, you can attach a list to a campaign by visiting the 'Campaign Logic' within the campaign editing screen and assign a list to each location within your app:
